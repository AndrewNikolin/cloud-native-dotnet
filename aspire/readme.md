## Getting Started

Make sure the `CarvedRock-Aspire.AppHost` project is set as the startup project.

Running this solution should launch the Aspire Dashboard where you can see the different
applications and services, as well as the logs and traces and metrics.

## Features

This is a simple e-commerce application that has a few features
that we want to explore cloud native delevopment for.

Here are the features:

- **API**
  - `GET` based on category (or "all") and by id allow anonymous requests
  - `POST` requires authentication and an `admin` role
  - Validation will be done with [FluentValidation](https://docs.fluentvalidation.net/en/latest/index.html) and errors returned as a `400 Bad Request` with `ProblemDetails`
  - A `GET` with a category of something other than "all", "boots", "equip", or "kayak" will return a `500 internal server error` with `ProblemDetails`
  - Data is refreshed to a known state as the app starts
- Authentication provided by OIDC via a (very) simple implementation of Duende IdentityServer

- **WebApp**
  - The home page and listing pages will show a subset of products
  - There is a page at `/Admin` that will show a list of products that can be added to (edit and delete not implemented)
  - If you navigate to `/Admin` without the admin role, you should see an `AccessDenied` page
  - Any validation errors from the API should be displayed on the admin section add page
  - Can add items to cart and see a summary of the cart (shows when empty too)
  - Can submit an order or cancel the order and clear the cart
  - A submitted order will send a fake email

## VS Code Setup

Running in VS Code is a totally legitimate use-case for this solution and
repo.

The same instructions above (Getting Started) apply here, but the following
extension should probably be installed (it includes some other extensions):

- [C# Dev Kit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit)

Then run the API project and the UI project.

## Data and EF Core Migrations

The `dotnet ef` tool is used to manage EF Core migrations.  The following command was used to create migrations (from the `CarvedRock.Data` folder).

```bash
dotnet ef migrations add Initial -s ../CarvedRock.Api
```

The initial setup for the application uses PostgreSQL.

### Switching Databases

Switching between Postgres and SQL Server is a matter
of commenting out the unused dbcontext setup / initialization logic and
commenting in what you want:

- `Program.cs` of the API project

You also need to manually delete the `CarvedRock.Data.Migrations`
folder and recreate the migrations using the instructions above.

Then you would also update the AppHost to use SQL Server and make corresponding
changes.

## Verifiying Emails

The very simple email functionality is done using a template
from [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/leemunroe/responsive-html-email-template)
and the [smtp4dev](https://github.com/rnwood/smtp4dev)
service that can easily run in a Docker container.

To see the emails just hit the link for the `smtp4dev` service in the Aspire Dashboard.
